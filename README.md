# Sort-Tool
My own version of the Unix command line tool sort. Implemented in JavaScript (lol - I may rewrite this in a either Haskell or Ocaml one day).

The tool features the following sorting algorithms:
  1. Quicksort
  2. Mergesort
  3. Heapsort
  4. Radixsort
  5. Randomsort

For the present moment the tool will only support txt files. I may add support for binary files at a later date.
